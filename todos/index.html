      <p class="center">Registration is made by the Popular Social Media Networks <br> like Github, Facebook, Twitter, etc, or email. Email Must Exist. [ Registration, Passwd Recovery ]</p>
    <p class="center"> The user decide his/her privacy.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="description center"> <br> <br>This platform will Not ask the user to add more personal information that the user already care to share by registration process.  <br><br>
    - Actions need to have more information about the user. GPS & Time Zone <br> <br>
    - GPS points & Time Zone information will be recorded in text format in User profile Actions List, with refered Path. <br> <br>
    - <b>Note</b>: Only Reported Videos which are reported as an Abuse which Violate License Principles, are not Deleted. <br> <br>
    - Privacy Rights can be Violated at Action Time in HCP (Human Care Path) <br>  <br>
    Because the Video serves as a Concept Proof, while in rating process, videos must be viewed by someone else.  <br><br> (random) When Video have a Final Stage (approved or Denied), Video Shall be Deleted! <br>  <br>
    GPS information have a animation propose of being a <b>pixel</b> point in a World Map that represents an approved action. <br> <br>
    I can imagine a world full of "light" moments, but better than imagine, would be to see it in real-time in reality!! <br> <br> 
This challenge don't care about how much secure You are, but if the actions are made. <br>  <br>Secure communications sometimes are slow and not good to Real Time Video Recording. <br> <br> If Player Have a good connetion, player only needs an email to start playing.  <br> <br>
