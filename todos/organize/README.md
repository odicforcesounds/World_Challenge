"Each Positive Contribution that Benefit other Living Being may have Value. The Value
is in the capacity of any person to solve any problem that may be solved by Social Values which care,"

---

## Problems to solve:

Create better relations in society between all living Beings:

> Associate Economic Value to what have value as well? 


``` 
By the principles of Freedom of Choice, 
to associate economic value to the simplicity of life is not good, 
because they become acts of business and not acts of freedom. 
In the other hand, industry and economy and everyone work, 
happen by the same principle. People do work ( actions ) and the reward have economic value.
Question: Does the work have no value? 
Answer: Only if each don't like what they are doing, 
and even then, where are the values / principles that guide their choices? 
This problem that is in everyone life as the unique condition of having free will of choice
is the ( economic value ), which have no face, since 
( all coins do that work, if they are real coins or virtual )
Maybe we can only point the common healthier choices as an option that have no value at all, 
but only to show others that we did something for someone, in Time! :D 
```


- Rate every Positive Contribution from others.

**Note**: "In Social and Justice Perspective, to ask apologies in a way, where the "victim" feels that the "attacker"
is trully sorry, is rated as a positive **Deed**. By the same concept, all "bad" actions which take any social responsability as mistakes, can be "fixed", May everyone be OpenSource to their own Source and to everyone else.

1.  Students: Behaviors / Choices
2.  Social: Behaviors / Choices
3.  Professional: Behaviors / Choices

        ~ Don't rate / promote every Negative Contribution from others.

        ~ Discuss / Talk / Present solutions to fix those.

        ~ The Bad behaviors shall not become more important than the good.

        ~ Promote Good behaviors ( at all levels of society and associate value to it )

## Objectives:

        - Each employee need to do more than what he/she aims to do. Rate That!

        - Associate Value to each detail, to each singular action.

2.  Each positive point represent one coin.

        - If the difference is in the atittude, then atittudes have value.

        - More than the product it self.

> **TODO**: Build list of human / social characteristics that can be rated.

1. Each positive point shall have associated economic value.

- Points point to the value of one singularity ( good deed )

  - That is the value: It can be exchanged! ("in favor of")
