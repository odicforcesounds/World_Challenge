/*
 * Actions is the function that control user concept proof.
 * This can be made by video-concept-proofs,
 * or by "anonymous rating" in association of a personal characteristic.
 * For example: John did wait for the results and few hours, without demonstrating any reactivity with others, therefor, workers of that company, rate John for being a person who have "patience" and "positive", in the way John did bhave.
* So John have X points from random company employees that share a gratitude, while recognizing his behavior as something good.
 * John can know his social skills, but the point here, is to motivate those choices. 
 * John could demonstrate anger and see everyone in that company as someone bad because he was upset. 
 * Those characteristics are not good to rate, because this application don't aims to motivate hate, but to motivate undestanding and self projection. 
 * The Video concept proof should be for legal proposes. I just like to talk with myself in videos, but not really showing my actons or choices from me to all others for self-evelation. 
 * I understand that, a lot of people have a concern here, while the world with or without those concerns, it is abusing from is!
