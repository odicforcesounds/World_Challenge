--- 

- Web interface described in site is included, but the rate system of company-employees was excluded. Finally they describe in this document, that they will use Firebase. 

- The funny thing is that, even without the main key features of the application, the price continue the same, while there is no guarantees that they will give me the source-code, there is no guarantees that the Web-Interface feature will list companies, since this application have no users at all.
