Introduction: 
Conversation in Audio Format is good to say "hello" and "goodbye", but not the best format to memorize ideas or organize them. 
Since you record some of our chats in Zoom, please check those, to remember that  some details where described there, that were not described somewhere else in text format. That is a good reason to remember that chats in video or audio, are not good to clear misunderstandings.  
Try to ignore all other documents, since I will try to be super explicit and very precise in details in this document. 
This project aims to create a system, which target industry, while I do not represent a Industry or Business. This means I cannot create a business based on this solution, without having a Legal company in my name. Else Industry would need to pay ilegally. ~
 Vijay, Vijayshree and all others: Sorry but I love to write a lot. 
Questions and Answers: 

1. How many Industries are registered? None. 
2. How many users are registered? None. 
3. How this application will become a business? No Idea. 
4. Do I intend to create a business? If Industry feedback is positive, I do.  
5. What are the necessary conditions to create this application? 
Have a FAKE list of companies above or bellow others based on their points.
Is good to undertand that this part is the most Important piece of all the project. Without it, I cannot explain or show anything to any other company / Industry, about how it works, or about how I aim to promote them. This is a FAKE list, because we have no Industries registered or Users, or Employees. 
Describe the methods that this application aims to use to create those points. 
Promoting the Rate system as an Extra system to motivate Industry to participate. 

This projects is divided in 3 Main  parts: 

1. The Android application that is made for 2 groups of people: Group A and Group B. 
Group A and Group B can use a system that rate other characteristics. 
Both Groups can create Videos. 
Only Group B can rate videos made by Group A, and Only Group B can create challenges to be made by Group A. 
Videos made by users, should have a GPS feature embeded, to guarantee that users don't "lie" or add random GPS points in Map. 
2. List of Companies below or above others based on their points is the Main WEB-PAGE. 
As a Second menu, a World-Map-Animation that make reference of Which challenges are waiting to be solved and which challenges are solved, using different colors. 
3. Another WEB-PAGE, to login as Admin to manage users and companies. 

BIG NOTE: ATENTION !!!! VERY IMPORTANT !!!! 
All Android Features are useless and NOT-IMPORTANT, before Industry demonstrate interess.
All Admin Features are useless and NOT-IMPORTANT, before Industry demonstrate interess and before creating a LEGAL business to be able to create this idea in reality. 
So if you think twice ( you only need to create a single page using FakerJS ) to be possible to demonstrate / present this challenge to any other human in this world.
