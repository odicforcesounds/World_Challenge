What Contradicts?

User in the context of being a student, characteristics need to be with teachers users to be rated, and teachers charateristics should be, in user application that are students. The same of all others. 

This "contradictions" that happen in all contexts of the examples 
listed, could represent a problem, but lets simplify it: 

All users have them? User should be able to select the correct context?
While we are in Time, eternal students and teachers, from the wise to the ignorant, and society love to police others, even not being officially police. We police documents, musics, persons, animals, code, texts, time.
 
nothing contradicts again,
if users know what is the context they are in. 

This lists that can only have "numeric values associated", should be a static JSON file as Template or several, where we should alter them and reflect in all clients. 
Easy to add more or to correct them and since they are a file in a github repository, values cannot change by script. (good for security) 


At the End, we find a better approach: 
If is a Free user, is a civilian: User have, personal, civilian, police, urgency, teachers and comercials characteristics active to rate.  
if is a Commercial user: User have, personal, police, urgency, teams and clients / civilian characteristics active to rate. 
if user is Police: It means that police did wish to participate in this challenge and therefor, user have the same characteristics from Commercial Services. 
if user is Urgency worker: it means that INEM, Red Cross, etc, did  wish to participate in this challenge and therefor, have the same characteristics of Commercial Services. 
If user is Teacher: It means that schools wish to participate in this challenge, and therefor user have students charateristics to rate.
