Understand the Condition to Develop a better Ignition

Source code from this app, needs to be at github. 

Since we can run Firebase or Like solutions from JavaScript, without exposing true identity, we can run and manage the project from there. 

For this cases, we only have two pages. 
One that list brands and nr of employees. 
Another as a login system for admins. 

Somehow Firebase or Like solutions, normally offer this, since for now, there is no company participating or in willing to. Not even investments to be possible to maintain this project. Who knows about the future... dreams... 

So, understand that I cannot maintain a Dedicated Server, with dedicated Databases, and so on. You should try to simplify it as much as possible.

I suggest following what is already defined by me in website music and symbology, that is using Firebase or many different Free services to make it possible.

You can even create a application that uses a Free Service database, for each piece of this project, which would result in "no costs" for big Time of Experimental use. 

You can create database for users, videos, rates and characteristics, companies rates, in different free services that offer the functionality you need.

So, if you find and investment for this project, make it possible, because I cannot. 
If you will don't help on that specific need, you should avoid thinking about dedicated Big company investment project.

The point is: if you develop this application based in the perspective that this project will run behind a Big company, you will think using NodeJS as you suggest, but that will not give me "big time for test".

If you find that this solution is possible to use and test with a dedicated server, you should present me the costs with the minimum, so I can decide, if I can support the cost for the experimental use for this first version. If you cannot give me that feedback, I cannot guarantee that I can support the project, and therefor I will deny. 

If you find investors for this project, without having the final and first experimental version of it, "I am glad to hear", but by logic conditions, investors may invest in some project that is already working. So, you will not find investors easly without the project running. If an investor like the product, we can rebuild the product and in that moment, we can concentrate our efforts to create a application with dedicated server.

I try to find some VPS prices, and I think that it may be possible to invest on it. Here is an example: https://www.ssdnodes.com/pricing/

If you know better ones, let me know.

For this specific example (ssdnodes) prices are acceptable ( for me ), which is not too much, since first 3 years have a promotion. So I can test World Wide Brands Challenge Application the first 3 years, without spending too much and in this case, you can continue the idea, where you are using NodeJS as server language to manage the sites. All machines run inside a KVM and I don't know if is possible to custom the instalation, but that is another subject I like to manage. 

If I could add a dedicated machine to this project using no-ip, for example, I could use a better machine, being a real machine, hosting the project at home. 

Hopefully you all read this comments and next wensday you already give me an answer about this, or suggesting me better solutions. 

This decision is up to you.  If you find a good and cheap solution, when you using a VPS, you can develop this project using NodeJS and MongoDB or NoSQL, or PostgreSQL or MySQL, etc.. if you cannot find solutions equal or better than the ssdnodes.com prices, I cannot guarantee I can effort the cost, and therefor the condition to use Firebase and other Free similar services, come up as the best choice for me. 

Hopefully you will develop this solution using NodeJS, but I give you that opportunity to decide. Maybe you know a lower Prices for VPS, which will result in a "yes" I can invest on that. 

Have a nice weekend. Let me know more in detail.
