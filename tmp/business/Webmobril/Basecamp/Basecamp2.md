This values that ChatGPT generate in this example I share in Gihub, can be discussed, but since we can add more text explaining what each value can be associated to, we can accept this kind of simplifications used by ChatGPT. If you have better suggestions, let me know. 

Note: "The Value is in between the relation of the value it self(1), which means, is in "you" and the "other" who did recognize that value on "you" or in reverse. This is the real value of this (rated values) that are at the end, coins. In the last link that link the word "between" to a bandcamp track, using zero when they ask you money to download the track, bypass the "problem". 

By License intention, include all groups who represent a Logo. 

Therefor, this system can be included in several relational groups that we have in society, pointing them into this "path", where this application exist as a tool to motivate positive participation, including this "exchange" that validate that efford by recognizing the efford of others.

Schools: {
Relation between teachers and students. 
Relation between students and students. 
Relation between teachers and teachers. 
Relation between all others in Schools. 
}

Police: {
Relation between police and civilian. 
Relation between civilian and police. 
}

Gov: {}

Companies: {
Relation between employees.
Relation between clients and employees.
}

Sports: {
Relation between players
Relation between all others
Relation between fans and team.
}

We always need the context, so ChatGPT or others LLMs, are good to find the context associated to the relation between different groups, while, if you think, you may be part of them. So, we assume that each user, will choose the correct context to add value.
