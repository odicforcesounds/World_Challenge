Here the word 'fragments' is all little pieces that I can imagine that need to exist, while I don't know how to code it, so maybe there is a lot more.

In reference of the document "About Rate Systems for Individuals", comments talk about this idea where Yin point to inside, and Yang points to outside, we have two main parts. 

1. The site, that only present companies above or below others, based on how many actions employees did, that had positive classification. (Yang)
Address to administration to manage site, should be somewhere else in between. 
For testing we can use any address you wish to use, but somewhere in time, I would like to have a completly separate address, for this login page, aways from any user. 

2. The application it self. (Yin)

Options: 
Scan QR code: (condition needed to identify other user and rate qualities)
Use Cam Picture: (condition needed: GPS Point only to Mark new Challenge) 
Paths.  

Inside 'Paths' 
1. NCP: Nature Care Path
2. ACP: Animal Care Path
3. HCP: Human Care Path

Inside this first Path's: (for the self) 
If user is company employee (registration made by adminstrators in backend)
Use Cam Video: (condition needed to create "concept proofs" to be rated)

Informative condition of exposing or not company information.
If free user (registration made by another way(can include the majority, another personal QR code? )) 
List videos aka "concept proofs" made by companies employees to be rated
Select video, watch it and rate it. (control watch time to prevent fast rating)
4. ICP: Industrial Care Path (products, and all crazy things that industry use) 
This last Path only exist, as a challenge for industry adminstrations, who may wish to share, documents that prove they are using healthy products, and many other possible challenges that can be investments as "charity" or company group actions. (this last "path" is not defined, or the points associated, that should be more than 1 for each employee participation) 

So at the end we have: 

# a "static" website that update results made by user companies

# a login only for admin and change pass asking email 
# no registration process is possible in this page. 

/* Application
1. Login and registration
2. Select Options
 
Note: This options / menus will try to be super informative */

Everything else is "clicking" and "living"
