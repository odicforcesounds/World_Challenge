Administrator should add company logo and employees emails associated.
Employees can rate each others behaviors.
Clients can rate employees behaviors.
No negative Rate ( zero is already negative )
select-characteristic and add 1 ( good )
no-characteristic selection = add 0 ( bad / null )
User should only rate 3 characteristics max each time.
Employees do actions that benefit 3 party persons. ( outsiders )
Each approved action reflect 1 coin to employee and 1 point to Company.
Each user have a list of personal, professional characteristics to be rated.
Each company can focus on challenges in the area they are.
9 Companies are above or below others companies based on the points they gain.
Public Registration (free of charge)
Only for non-commercial users.
User can select Company-Employee to rate characteristic (using QRCode?)
User can Mark in Map, point-zone to be treated as a Challenge?
Maybe this point was what create confusion ( but only you know )
You didn't say anything: The idea is that video have GPS feature. When a user create a video that is a challenge, "GPS Point in Map is automatic added" 
Challenges can be
Human Care (Red)
Animal Care (Green)
Nature Care (Blue)
User approve or deny employee-company-action concept-proof (video )
select (1) = Approved
select (0) = Denied
Main site (app.odicforcesounds.com) should have:
Top-menu-Tab ( Companies list rating )
Company Logo
Company name
Company site
Company number-of-employees (should be possible to list companies based on number of employees to ascend or descend.
Top-menu-Tab ( World-Map Marked-Points Animation )
Orange color: challenge to solve
Cyan Color: challenge Solved


So, the communication gap can be related to one of two conditions: 
1. You didn't read my text links
2. I write a lot of stuff that is not important to you and you confuse ideas. 
 
Your last proposal was sent days later... 

Everyone can make mistakes, but as you can read, the description of Map view is there from the very beggining. 

I can even change the main idea, if you explain why I should... ( but you need to explain why ) .. not being in Silence. In this case, it make sense to be inside the application.. if  video features             doesn't not include the GPS feature to ensure that the challenge is not Random... as a user can select any point and you need to go to that place to verify ... 

I think how to prevent abuse... but everything can be abused. 
New boost
