The license targets everyone. 

This is a Question for all of you, while giving you the answer. 
Your company, by functional propose, is already free from "Monkey" Eternal License. Why? 
Just another challenge for you to participate and explain the reasons, leading me to understand, that you understand.

If any developer company wish to participate, is free to participate, but is not mandatory, since...

Office work is like developing and developing is like office work.

Developer Teams industry can have that feature too, recognizing good "helpers" from others and being the reverse of it. A "helper".

Site reference: "We Are Tools - Objects of Expression" 

So, by the principles of Buddism, Hinduism and T/Daoism, that where the religions in history that develop knowledge to Care others, because this religions, point to the Self. (Yin) 

Monotheism point to others. (Yang)
Create confronts about what is "a personal choice" of each, if each is in the will to prove that is right about what he/she believe. (This contradicts my own site and myself, since that site is a way to prove knowledge about the 道. Is a fact that I don't need to listen others approval, which contradicts the idea that my site and me, contradicts) :D 
Nordic Paganism point to Nature, but it point to conflicts and wars too. (sadly)
This is all about "intentions", and the intention of this site, is in the title names that represent something deeper. The music is only a complement, texts and images too, but they have that "intention" as much as possible.

In the Album "道 Expression", the there is a track that demonstrate my condition in business world: "Hunting Dreams Hunters"  

So, You already know, I am looking for "them". 

By the way, I feel happy to believe that India break (as possible) Castas. They where like a Eternal discriminational system. The only thing that I see negative in Hinduism. In that aspect, this application propose contradicts Castas. :D
