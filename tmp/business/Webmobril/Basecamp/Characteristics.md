"For each personal charateristic, rate what you 'see in others'"

Hello, and thank you for having me here.

Maybe you already know about me and my work, but since I have a mind problem associated to the meaning of what is expressed, I will share some keys about it.

Why and How?
Some mystical body and mind experience I had, where some electrical content 'fall' in my head, leading me to create all music tracks in the name of Odicforcesounds, (The Sounds of "Chi", "Prana", "Odic force") resulting in 22 albums.

In Chinese Zodiacs I am a Metal Monkey, so all start from that illusion, of being something that I can be, being me, being free to be a Monkey.

Then I start to create the site by myself.
Most of tracks and albums texts and poems are made with ChatGPT, where i just give the "script" of the objective of the texts. All others are written by me.

The 道 represents the YinYang flowing in Time.

The Yin is 1 while being 2. Light inside, Dark outside.
The Yang is 1 while being 2. Dark inside, Light outside.

The Chinese believe that the 道 is the Path.
This "Path" is described in many books saying something like this: "First something super simple and complex at the same time, was flowing in Time. From that "nothing/everything" comes the 1, from the 1, comes the 2, from the 2 comes the 3, and from the 3 the 10.000 things."

So, the Path is made of "3 steps", where everything can be explained using them.

So, I think about it, and express it as:
Imagination( ) + Logic(Spirit) = Application(Expression)
Which means: 1 + 1 = 1 OR 3 See it here.
Music is not bad and poem is made by me.
Music track is called "Memórias e Saudade", which means "Memories and (the emotion that each can feel, when missing something/someone in Time)".

In my interpretation, the 道 or the "Path", have the "illusion(imagination)" and a "condition(logic)". So, in the above link, if you click on the "Om" link at the table, you will go into a page that express the condition of that illusion, in me. The Expression in that table sequence, uses the Kaballah as a background with some images I add there, which is a old system that represent many things, including the Chakras. In the middle, is all about the Solar Plexus, which is represented as Fire. Some interpretations about Solar Plexus, point to "The Eyes of God".

In China "Sun Wukong" is just a story about a Monkey.
In India "Hanuman" is just a Monkey.
In Japan "3 Monkey" is just a story about Monkeys.

About the Eyes: In 2015 I made the first 8 albums, as it was in that year I had this mystic experience, and as a Facebook user, I started to tag several times "Boom Festival" page, with several messages. In the next year Boom Festival announce the "World Wide Shamanic Call", and in 2016 I find I tag page saying "Eyes on You - Boom Festival por Oscar Macedo".

Boom festival uses a "Dragon" as a Logo. In Asian cultures mainly China and Japan associated to Zodiacs, there are 3 main animals with "particular" duties. The Dragon, the Tiger and the Monkey.


The Monkey aims to create a Challenge with Social activities, as a Game.
And that is what we going to build here. I feel I will learn a lot. Thank You.

I am alone, no investment company, no plan on how convince companies to participate in this challenge. Is part of Monkey illusion, as a product.

Since you are from India, I have the illusion that you will understand this message.
But like all other illusions, they point to a probability, without knowing if is true, since for being true, by logic you would understand the message.

So the question is: Do you feel Synchronized?


From the Album: "Emotional Signals"
Audio-Track Text-Reference:
"Social Tool Kit - World Wide Conscience Cleaner"

In the world of words, where meanings take flight,
A monkey's voice joins, seeking truth and light.
For educational purposes, let's embark,
Close your eyes , and see beyond the dark.

Open your eyes, what visions do you behold?
What actions can you take, what stories unfold?
This challenge we face, mirrors life's sway,
In this world, we're free to play our way.

Time's signals guide us, beyond thoughts alone,
It's through our actions that true seeds are sown.
Caring, in some way or another, we find,
A karma healing game, for hearts to unwind.

Our personal vitae, a reflection of who we are,
Civic actions woven into life's memoir.
Social and political, combined in stride,
As we discover, they're one, side by side.

For I am a lover of music's sweet grace,
Of nature's beauty, animals we embrace.
But above all, it's humanity I hold dear,
Because I love the essence, it's crystal clear.

Education's process, built on repetition's sway,
For those lacking care for nature's display.
Motivation lacking, for survival's plea,
For even those who possess not, need to be.

In this world where money dictates our pace,
Where conditions demand survival's embrace,
Coins may differ, objects hold diverse sway,
But value, always expressed by choices we lay.

So let us be the monkey, wise and true,
Embracing our conscience, both me and you.
In this social toolkit, we'll cleanse the soul,
And let compassion and love become our goal.

No wars, no pain, but actions to define,
As the monkey's voice echoes, a universal sign.
New boostPeople here just ignore the fact, that this application is a "social Tool Kit", that aims to care living beings. Therefor, the Designers have low sensibility for this themes / subjects. Something that is dedicated to Care living beings use Black and Dark Pink. I don't know, where Nature and Animals or Humans remember this Dark Colors, but I assume that I am not sensible to this kind of subjects.
