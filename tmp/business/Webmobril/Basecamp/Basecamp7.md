In my mind, I would say that the link to login / register new users, should be by  clicking the link of "sign in" on this page table.

This table is in a static HTML page, but I can redirect that link to somewhere else, like you can see in the example ( nothing there but links works fine ).

The idea is that the "artistic content" is associated with the "logic content" that in this case, is the application for free users.

As you may see, Code is already pointing to Github, while License points to Rights, that ask Duties, which include by logic, Deeds. 

The "Monkey King" is some kind of Hero, but for this application, employees and companies become the "objects" that represent the "heroes", that don't fight in any way, but help in any way, while this "helping choice" is in fact a "hero choice".

So, remember that the "serious" content of this application in documentation perspective, it mix both sites. The Artistic site promotes the application documentation and registration, while the application should promote the artistic site, by linking some specific "words" that are defined as "music tracks titles" and "text descriptions", as the example used. 

In Fact we can say that all concepts behind the ÈÅì are for children. So this is a way to find in others, the children on them. That enthusiasm that children demonstrate for many things, that are the List of characteristics: Personal, common to all users.

For now we only care about the positive characteristics, while later we can add the "negative", but pointing them as suggestions to care, not a negative value that will "define" the users that present that "negative" characteristic, based on behaviors or personal choices. 

We can point to the negative choices as something that can become better, giving suggestions, while denying to declare them as "static" characteristics of a person.
