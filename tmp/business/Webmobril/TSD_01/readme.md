# WebMobril First Proposal v1.0

- Business need is to have a mobile application which allows users (Who would be an company employee) to take participate in challenges active on the mobile application. Employees/users can skip login and later login at the time of participation. No participation fee will be levied on users while registration.

- They don't show from where this idea comes, but this first idea have origin in the perspective that (me) would talk to companies to register their own employees into this challenge. For this, the fee is asked to companies administrators, not to their employees. Company already pay the fee for their employees, so employees don't need to pay more. (make sense?)

- Reading the main site, we find this linkL: https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com/src/en/points.html (Industry Points) ... Since they didn't read it, they ignore the content. 

- So, we know that this first proposal include translation of several languages, a admin panel and the android application. The only detail that was ignored is the list of characteristics that employees get from their professional performance. https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com/src/en/industry.html 

- So, I told them that and ask a new proposal. In conversation with 'vjs', I told her that some details were in the next page: 
https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Spiritual_Algorithmic/tracks/01_The_Challenge/index.html

- I guess they didn't read that page too, while I ask them to use Firebase.

- Their proposal includes NodeJS which ask a dedicated server and the price for the server was not included in the proposal.
