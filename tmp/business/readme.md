# Introduction & Abstraction

About this application: [World Brands Competition](https://wiki.odicforcesounds.com)

This application is described with all features in the last link. The company didn't read the content of that page. In the **Experience** topic of this page, in the **First Proposal**, we can see that they didn't read it, since the text they present, describe the several links of the main page, as being different challenges. For some moments I thought that the problem of communication was my fault, but I can see that the problem was that they didn't read it. I put a child of 12 years reading the content and thinking about what features the application would need to have. This child is not super intelligent or genious, but she describe all features that this application need to have. The next [Link](https://github.com/odicforcesounds/World_Challenge/issues/14#issuecomment-2541265605) describe all this features in a EXPLICIT way, and even then this company had some problems in it's interpretation. I guess the language can be the difference, while today they call me, and told me thatm, **the cost of server is not their problem**, and for that, they would share the information of the cost, later, after application development, which is a demonstration that they don't care about their clients needs.. A demonstration of disrespectuful attitude. Personally I can be honest and make use of **Humility**, but when I see that the other part is trying to make fun of me, I demonstrate myself offensive. In this last call, they even told me that the "timestone" have a limit time, but they didn't told me nothing about in the begining of our communication,or in any of their proposals. Well, since they were not explicit with me, that is not my problem. [Call Me Karma](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Shiva_and_Kali_Dance/tracks/14_Call_me_Karma/)

The last links are without modification for more than 2 years. A child of 12 years who read them, is not better than a Developer team with more than 8 years of experience (is what they say). 

## Application Description 

1. [Social Tool Kit - World Wide Conscience Cleaner](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/11_Social_Tool_Kit/index.html)
- The last link is made of a text, that aims to describe the application in a poetic style, but giving some keys that include the main subjects of it's root concepts. 
2.  [The Game Project - Is Fun to Take Care](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Emotional_Signals/tracks/10_The_Game_Project/index.html)
- The last link is another page, that describe the intention of the application, pointing into the direction of being a game that aims to motivate acts of care from industry. 
3. [The Challenge](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Spiritual_Algorithmic/tracks/01_The_Challenge/index.html)
- The last link is the technical description of this application, inside a imaginary world, which describe **all** subjects that this application aims to cover in a technical way and in a subjective way, describing **all features** that are the **main keys** of the application it self. 

## Application Development - Key Concepts

This application aims to use some pre-defined technology, like Firebase and Github. The description that point to this requirements are defined in this website [License](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/License/index.html), and all audio-tracks, from the same audio-album of the page **The Challenge**, which include the audio track, **[Firebase - Solar Plexus](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Spiritual_Algorithmic/tracks/06_Firebase_Solar_Plexus/index.html)** and **[Dive into the World of JavaScript](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Spiritual_Algorithmic/tracks/04_Into_the_World_of_JavaScript/index.html)**. The **License** aims to cover the artistic approach and the application it self. 

## Business - The Company 

This application is in this moment being defined by **Webmobril** company, while some problems exist, which put me in a fragile position, because most of them are a lack of transparency as well, a lack of descriptive texts, that unable me to feel secure and confident. 

## The client - Me 

The client feel the need to explain the concepts behind the application and the reasons that have behind it's intention. This behavior can be in my opinion, useful, but sometimes I think that developers don't really care about it, if not many times, confuse them. Maybe is the biggest lesson that I can extract from everything that is going bad, but at the other hand, I see that the problem can be a lack of attention. I will describe details, explaining why. 

## The experience 

The First [proposal](./Webmobril/TSD_01/readme.md) didn't include some of the keys features described in the audio-track **The Challenge**, and exclude one of the main keys that should be the animation in a web-page. In this proposal, we can notify that the developers didn't read the main page, nor all others. In this proposal they recommend using NodeJS substituting Firebase, but didn't announce the cost of the server, but the services that were included in the price of the service. 

The Second [proposal](./Webmobril/TSD_02/readme.md) include most of the features, incrementing the price. The feature of the animation in web-page is not included. This proposal is the best one, since it includes most of the features described in the page **The Challenge**. In this proposal they continue recomending the use of NodeJS, without listing the cost of the server, removing the page that include the services of the cost, like updates, fixing bugs, etc. 

The Third [proposal](./Webmobril/TSD_03/readme.md) remove the main features of the application, becomming similar to the first one, but without most of the features included in the backend. This proposal is a joke. They remove most of the features included in the last two proposals, while the proposal it self don't include the price, which lead me to understand, that the price continue the same. Here for the **first time they include Firebase Services** [Firebase site list the price of the services]. This proposal have some **positive** point. They add a Fake list of companies that are above or below others. Then I ask them if the real companies will be presented in this list, or another. I had no answers about that. 

I gave them "Total Freedom to define the UI/UX of this application", but one thing is *what I like* and another is *what people who will use it, like*, which means, colors should be connected to the idea of the application intention, and not to what I like or dislike. 

## Legal Issues

Since I do not represent a company that offer a service, I cannot ask other companies some fee to register their employees. Facing with this problem I try to find some solution, while Webmobril didn't advice me any solution. Therefor I change the obligatory fee to register companies to free, asking them to add a "donation bottom", inside the android application. 

## The Symbolic part 

The main site is full of symbology and spiritual knowledge that sometimes I try to explain it in a rational style. Includes Taoism, Hinduism and Buddhism. Having a system that control actions inside economy is as well, part of the idea that the Islamic book aims to add, as something that should exist in economy, to limit industry / economy freedom.  

The Logo of this application can be a Yin Yang, since the ÈÅì is all about Yin Yang.
