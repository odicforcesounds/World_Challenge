- The last link is the technical description of this application, inside a imaginary world, which describe **all** subjects that this application aims to cover in a technical way and in a subjective way, describing **all features** that are the **main keys** of the application it self. 

## Application Development - Key Concepts

This application aims to use some pre-defined technology, like Firebase and Github. The description that point to this requirements are defined in this website [License](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/License/index.html), and all audio-tracks, from the same audio-album of the page **The Challenge**, which include the audio track, **[Firebase - Solar Plexus](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Spiritual_Algorithmic/tracks/06_Firebase_Solar_Plexus/index.html)** and **[Dive into the World of JavaScript](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/Data/Audio/Spiritual_Algorithmic/tracks/04_Into_the_World_of_JavaScript/index.html)**. The **License** aims to cover the artistic approach and the application it self. 

## Business - The Company 

This application is in this moment being defined by **Webmobril** company, while some problems exist, which put me in a fragile position, because most of them are a lack of transparency as well, a lack of descriptive texts, that unable me to feel secure and confident. 

## The client - Me 

The client feel the need to explain the concepts behind the application and the reasons that have behind it's intention. This behavior can be in my opinion, useful, but sometimes I think that developers don't really care about it, if not many times, confuse them. Maybe is the biggest lesson that I can extract from everything that is going bad, but at the other hand, I see that the problem can be a lack of attention. I will describe details, explaining why. 

## The experience 

The First [proposal](./Webmobril/TSD_01/readme.md) didn't include some of the keys features described in the audio-track **The Challenge**, and exclude one of the main keys that should be the animation in a web-page. In this proposal, we can notify that the developers didn't read the main page, nor all others. In this proposal they recommend using NodeJS substituting Firebase, but didn't announce the cost of the server, but the services that were included in the price of the service. 

The Second [proposal](./Webmobril/TSD_02/readme.md) include most of the features, incrementing the price. The feature of the animation in web-page is not included. This proposal is the best one, since it includes most of the features described in the page **The Challenge**. In this proposal they continue recomending the use of NodeJS, without listing the cost of the server, removing the page that include the services of the cost, like updates, fixing bugs, etc. 

The Third [proposal](./Webmobril/TSD_03/readme.md) remove the main features of the application, becomming similar to the first one, but without most of the features included in the backend, while the price keeps the same. This proposal is a joke. They remove most of the features included in the last two proposals, while the proposal it self don't include the price, which lead me to understand, that the price continue the same. Here for the first time they include Firebase Services. 

I gave them "Total Freedom to define the colors of this application", but one thing is "what I like" and another is "what people who will use like", which means, that colors should be connected to the idea of the application intention, and not to what I like or dislike. 

## The Symbolic part 

The Logo of this application can be a Yin Yang, since the ÈÅì is all about Yin Yang. 

1 + 1 = 1 OR 3 [Tao](https://art.odicforcesounds.com/pages/YinYang/Tao/index.html)

The main site is full of symbology and spiritual knowledge that sometimes I try to explain it in a rational style.
